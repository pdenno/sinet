 [I think I missed the whole point in the stuff below, but just to be sure: There are messages that
  are not associated with transitions. They are associated with STATES. I may have a place in the network
  that is essentially "M1-BLOCKED" but it won't be labelled as such! A nice thing about this is that 
  I DON'T WANT to get a M1-BLOCKED message every (vanishing) time that there is a token in that place.
  I only want these when the buffer is filled (a state where the buffer place looms large). That's what 
  will happen, and we don't have to worry about labeling the "m1-blocked" place!]

 In some cases like blocking/starving it seem that having a place represent the state is appropriate. 
 But is that generally the case? This ToDo is closely related to the next about vanishing transitions,
 but I don't think it is the same issue. I think I need to see the result of the "mild blocking" 
 situation before I can sort this out. Remember that the goal is to get rates out of these things. 

 (More on this): I think there might be quirk to what I'm trying to do: I'd like to allow the PN to handle 
 exceptional messages just as some do for block/starve, but block/starve are places, not transitions, and 
 they won't have meaningful names. I think I'll just wait to explore this after getting the exceptional 
 fitness hooked in.

        many jobs one machine can get ahead of the next machine. However, you don't know

* Discussion
** Rationale for PNN
It is clear that I need a means to explain messages that do not correspond to transitions. 
I need to discover the pattern associated with these other messages, if such a pattern exists. 
The PNN is just the way to do this. Do we associate a semantics to these messages? We can assume
that in general that may not be possible, but there is a "PN semantics" in the case
of blocking and starvation that it would be useful to know. (Likewise for competition for
resources and deadlocking). In the blocking/starvation cases, there is still the matter
of determining where the problem buffer is. Once starving happens it continues upstream, 
and blocking continues downstream. (You could check for that in the causal model.)
Likewise could look at non-delivery of a part from a feeder line. 

*** Think about the role of PNN in causal modeling
The nice thing here is that using the parametric infinitessimal, I'll have real-numbered 
quantities of tokens in places. The PNN essentially shows the state changes while I move around the parameters.

*** Think about what is being inferred. 
*** What role do the "starving/blocking" places have? Can they be added?
*** Define the steps 
   - recognition of a pattern
   - hypothesis generation
   - hypothesis testing (causal? comparison?)
   - [TODO] Consider "evolution in stages" where fitness changes when milestones are reached.
** IDEA: Maybe award fitness to PNs that represent exceptional messages.
***  Award a little less to those who can at least cope with it with a NN. 

** Integrating exceptional fitness   
No starting links because nothing can parse the log. Every individual is capable of only describing
the path of a single job through the production resources. I think I have few options:

***  Obsolete?
****  1) Hope for a population that gets it right.
   Use genetic operators to produce more varied individuals, including some that 
   might parse the log well enough to get an exceptional msg table with markings that
   can guide design.

****  2) Use a next-ordinary-on-job
   Instead of next-ordinary, use next-ordinary-on-job. That will provide a parse
   and lead to the need for queues. 

   You could apply this to multiple jobs, but would that be helpful?

****  3) Give some more thought about how the reachability graph can do this. 

***  Summary (and msg-table)
Preparation to do (1) and (2) is the same, I think: It must be possible to 
use the msg table markings to update the PN. This is a "semantic genetic operator"

{:m1-blocked   {[3 0 1 1 0] 30},
 :m1-unblocked {[2 1 0 1 0] 30},
 :m2-starved   {[0 0 1 0 1] 14},
 :m2-unstarved {[0 0 1 1 0] 14},
 :ordinary
 {[0 1 0 1 0] 203,
  [2 0 1 1 0] 511,
  [1 1 0 1 0] 263,
  [3 0 1 0 1] 248,
  [1 0 1 1 0] 466,
  [0 1 0 0 1] 14,
  [2 1 0 1 0] 248,
  [3 0 1 1 0] 248,
  [1 0 1 0 1] 217,
  [0 0 1 1 0] 217,
  [0 0 1 0 1] 14,
  [2 0 1 0 1] 263}}

But that is a msg-table for N=3. A table for N=1 would have 1/0 for the first component of block/unblock.
So what? 

But why doesn't an individual emerge from evolution that can do this?
The winning individual came real close after just two iterations. 

***  After 30 generations I still didn't get one. 
***  Struggle
(You need 5 places and just the four transitions.) The only mistake
was an arc from the buffer to m2-complete-job. That arc should have
went to m2-start job. I think it may have stopped because success is <= 1 ??? Nope: we are looking for 0.1 or better.

***  Idea: I'm following jobs, what if instead I followed machines? (Or did both?)
Essentially what is wrong with the algorithm now is that it doesn't look at what machines do.
A Machine accepts/creates a part and starts work on it. It puts/destroys a part when done. 
These are patterns I could inject into the initial population, similar to what I do for jobs. 
What I really need are operators that combine the two viewpoints!!!
**** I sort of fixed this with util/related-places etc used in setting the initial-marking

***  Struggle
   I'm going to cut the pop down to 25 and cut out lots of operators. 
   Not enough experimentation yet, but so far, that didn't work. 

***  Let's force one close to this: [[file:~/TwoDrive/OneDrive/Repo/mindmaps/images/close-to-correct-pn.jpg][hopeful-pn]]
Find the PN for this on Sunday 2017-10-29. 
** GP Operators 
*** Need better notion of locality!
**** hopeful-pn with an initial-marking [1 0 0 0 0] (where first is place-1)
     Doesn't even get a rgraph, yet it is SO CLOSE! 
***** The above before I thought about pnu/set-initial-mark related-machine, etc.
***** Certainly more to say about locality, but that's it for now!
*** Semantic operators
**** Example failure is hopeful-pn with initial-marking token on place-1


* Sinet Log *
** <2017-10-14 Sat>
*** I started with this log file: [[file:~/Documents/git/sinet/data/SCADA-logs/m2-j1-n3-block-out.clj::%5B][m2-j1-n3-block-out.clj]] which blocks like crazy. 
*** I switched from returning 'the first' good starting marking to all markings.
*** I then compared the results from all three:

I am indexing the nets by the starting state. Each will associate a different marking with the
exceptional msg (defined as :fires-on). They all map [3 0 1 1 0] to the highest value of the NN.
Yet only the second one was trained for that outcome! The problem is that higher values are
going to drive the NN higher. (For example [10 0 1 1 0] give values even closer to 1 in each case.)
I can at least conclude that the one with the correct starting marking has the most prominent max
value (0.398 versus 0.213) is almost double, whereas the others are only  (0.57 versus 0.53) and
(0.71 vs 0.67) In all three cases, second best is [3 1 0 1 0].

**** Advantage: 
     The correct starting state has fewer false positives. It will do best. 

n**** Problem: 
     The algorithm is just going to focus on the buffer being high/low. This is fine for 
     blocking/starving events but not good for state-but-not-transition situations.

*** Does it make sense to have an entry point with no :fire-ons?  (Yes, but...)
 I get two entry point markings, only one has anything in :fires-on. 
 I search for 50 steps supposedly, but it goes 225 lines, ending on the only exceptional msg, 
 which is {:act :m2-starved, :indx 225, :Mp [1 0 1 0 1]}. None of that should matter, we
 aren't looking for exceptional one yet. 
**** Is the problem that it is using the short data?
**** Yeah, ok this is wrong! : 
     (def foo (interpret-scada reach1 (-> (app-info) :problem :scada-log) lili))
     (count foo) ==> 225
     So I have been using the wrong data all the time, or it is stopping early?
     Good! It is stopping after 225 (the other goes 3000). I'm guessing that it gets 
     stuck in a situation it cannot interpret. Verify...
   
     Here is the new "failed-on" information:
     {:failed-prior   {:M [1 0 1 1 0], :fire :m2-complete-job, :Mp [1 0 1 0 1], :rate 1.0, :indx 224},
      :failed-on-link {:act :m2-starved, :indx 225, :Mp [1 0 1 0 1]},
      :failed-on-msg  {:act :m1-complete-job, :bf :b1, :j 1745, :n 0, :clk 2067.08452126566, :line 226, :mjpact :bj, :m :m1}}

     According to the reachability graph, the only thing that can occur after [1 0 1 0 1] is :m2-start-job
     {:M [1 0 1 0 1], :fire :m2-start-job, :Mp [0 0 1 1 0], :rate 1.0}
     That makes sense because ...
      [:buffer     1
       :m1-blocked 0
       :m1-busy    1
       :m2-busy    0
       :m2-starved 1]
      ... No, it doesn't make sense. [1 1 0 0 1] should also be possible. This is a vanishing transition to :m1-blocked.
***** BUG 
      The reachability graph must be wrong, but before I fix it, I won't build nets where :failed-on-msg is on last. DONE. 
      Something is seriously wrong. I created pnml for the N=3 PN but I don't get the same reachability as I did earlier

      Even the N=1 net is wrong. It should have 12 links, not 10:

** <2017-10-16 Mon>
 So far there is only one NN per message. 

I cleaned things up so that I get one NN per message. 

I studied Probabilistic Neural Nets briefly. They require one neuron for each training instance
and therefore for my application I think would be equivalent of a lookup table encompasing the whole
training set. I think they make more sense when there are points "between" the elements in the
training set. (Do I have these???) Needs more study, but maybe not so promising.

Let's look at how these things do against the 

** <2017-10-17 Tue>

*** Cortex
Cortex layer types (what I'm seeing [[https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex/commit/4be1c559675b9612249abbb94963d989d70817fe][here]]): convolutional, max-pooling, dropout, relu, linear, softmax.
But *this* matters: [[https://machinelearningmastery.com/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/][Confusion matrix]]: Describes what one is and how to calculate one for the 2-class
classification problem!

[[https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Part-2/][Nice discussion of use of layers in CNN]].

**** Dropout 
     Seems to be primarily about overfitting and regularization - introducing additional information to solve ill-posed problems
     Regularization is NOT what I want. 

     "The idea of dropout is simplistic in nature. This layer “drops out” a random set of activations in that 
      layer by setting them to zero. Simple as that. Now, what are the benefits of such a simple and seemingly 
      unnecessary and counterintuitive process? Well, in a way, it forces the network to be redundant. 
      By that I mean the network should be able to provide the right classification or output for a specific 
      example even if some of the activations are dropped out"

**** Max-pooling
     Used in convolutional NNs. Use biggest value on a window. [[https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/pooling_layer.html][example here]]. The goal is to reduce spatial dimensions (but not depth)
     on a convolutional NN. Not what I want.

**** ReLu [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27319931/relu-and-dropout-in-cnn][here]]. (Rectified Linear Unit, Not a layer, the activation function of a single neuron.)
     The rectifier function is an activation function f(x) = Max(0, x) which can be used by neurons just like 
     any other activation function, a node using the rectifier activation function is called a ReLu node. 
     The main reason that it is used is because of how efficiently it can be computed compared to more conventional 
     activation functions like the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, without making a significant difference to 
     generalisation accuracy. The rectifier activation function is used instead of a linear activation function to 
     add non linearity to the network, otherwise the network would only ever be able to compute a linear function.

     This part sounds useful "to add non-linearity to the network, otherwise the network would only ever be able to
     compute a linear function." That is the problem I'm experiencing now. 

**** Convolutional 
     They aren't fully connected...

**** Softmax (Not a layer, the activation function of a single neuron.)
     In mathematics, the softmax function, or normalized exponential function is a generalization of the 
     logistic function that "squashes" a K-dimensional vector z of arbitrary real values to a K-dimensional vector 
      {\displaystyle \sigma (\mathbf {z} )} \sigma (\mathbf {z} ) of real values in the range [0, 1] that add up to 1.
     (wikipedia)
     [[https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-nano-foundation/wiki/ReLU-and-Softmax-Activation-Functions][Softmax and ReLU]].

**** Probabilistic Neural Nets
   [[https://web.archive.org/web/20101218121158/http://herselfsai.com/2007/03/probabilistic-neural-networks.html][Start here]].


*** Confusion matrix
"A confusion matrix is a technique for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm."
Thus if I have one of these, I can use it directly to determine the fitness of the combination of
PN + NNs as an identification of the system. 

Easy enough. Should also look at precision, recall, specificity and sensitivity. 
These are all defined on this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix][wikipedia page]]. I also have a paper by D. M. W. Powers in the ML
section of Mendeley.

*** fitness.clj
I think before I go much further, I have to fix the problem any problems deciding the class. 
I had hoped that it was just a matter of choosing marking > 0.5. Is this the case? 

HELP! No marking hits on any exceptional message. I don't think I have looked at results
since the "dense" exceptional messages of Saturday. 

*** What does the marking used as input to training mean?
    I was hoping that it was the marking just before the message is issued. 
    Messages are issued on complete-job / start-job but MJPdes doesn't 
    order these where they all happen simultaneously. Maybe it should???

[:buffer :m1-blocked :m1-busy :m2-busy :m2-starved]
 {:msg-type :m1-blocked,   [3 0 1 1 0] 30} ... I assume next msg is m1-complete-job
 {:msg-type :m1-unblocked, [2 1 0 1 0] 30} ... 
 {:msg-type :m2-starved,   [0 0 1 0 1] 14} 
 {:msg-type :m2-unstarved, [0 0 1 1 0] 14} 
 
Let's generate the interpretation [[file:~/Documents/git/sinet/data/SCADA-logs/m2-j2-n3-block-mild-interpreted.clj::{:act%20:m1-blocked,%20:prev-act%20:m1-start-job,%20:indx%20710,%20:Mp%20%5B3%200%201%201%200%5D,%20:clk%202206.0879216608246}][AND SAVE IT AS A FILE]]. 

Start link is the same for all 4 message types, yet I interpret the log four times. Nice.

Let's go back to the dense messages and see if we still get good results.



Some bad news (Sort of. Hey, we need an interesting paper!): With more exceptional instances
things work pretty well.

[:buffer :m1-blocked :m1-busy :m2-busy :m2-starved]
{:m1-unblocked
 [{:marking [0 1 0 1 0], :value 0.50118328747075}
  {:marking [1 1 0 1 0], :value 0.5228651697897436}
  {:marking [2 1 0 1 0], :value 0.5181440750582226}],
 :m1-blocked 
 [{:marking [3 1 0 1 0], :value 0.546424705570647} 
  {:marking [3 0 1 1 0], :value 0.5841860833305524}]}

...actually the unblocks look goofed up. 

This is not correct (or at least not best):

[:buffer :m1-blocked :m1-busy :m2-busy :m2-starved]

How did m1-starting a job result in there being another job in the buffer?!?!?!
  {:M [1 1 0 1 0], :fire :m1-start-job, :Mp [2 0 1 1 0], :rate 1.0, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :indx 2984}
  {:act :m1-blocked, :prev-act :m1-start-job, :indx 2985, :Mp [2 0 1 1 0], :clk 3720.7720757450656}

The "out" log: (it shows the buffer being full, m2 pulling one, m1 completing one which would set it back to N=3.

{:act :m2-start-job, :bf :b1, :j 1082, :n 3, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2981, :mjpact :sm, :m :m2}
{:act :m1-complete-job, :bf :b1, :j 1085, :n 2, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2982, :mjpact :bj, :m :m1}
{:act :m1-unblocked, :m :m1, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2983, :mjpact :ub}
{:act :m1-start-job, :j 1086, :jt :jobType1, :ends 3720.7720757450656, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2984, :mjpact :aj, :m :m1}

The above  would be easier to read as this:

{:act :m2-start-job, :bf :b1, :j 1082, :n 3,    :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2981, :mjpact :sm, :m :m2}
{:act :m1-unblocked, :m :m1,                    :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2983, :mjpact :ub}
{:act :m1-complete-job, :bf :b1, :j 1085, :n 2, :clk 3719.7720757450656, :line 2982, :mjpact :bj, :m :m1} (move job)
{:act :m1-start-job, :j 1086, :jt :jobType1,    :clk 3719.7720757450656, :ends 3720.7720757450656, :line 2984, :mjpact :aj, :m :m1}

FIX MJPdes: 
- MJPdes ought to report things upstream happening first. (sort that way (upstream? x y)
- Everything would be easier to read if :clk was first, then :act.

I implement the PNN algorithm from [[http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~sis01xh/teaching/CY2D2/Pattern3.pdf][here]].

The key think I'm learning is that you can have the same marking associated with many classes. 
But if a class only has one datapoint, it wins when you hit it. This is good! This 
might be useful for distinguishing the size of buffers with different "best-interpretations."

All of this will be useful when I want to compare to the steady-state behavior using 
a parametric infinitessimal! 

(ppprint (subvec (best-interpretation pnpn (-> (app-info) :problem :scada-log)) 0 300))

Interestingly, starve and unstarve are coming up as both ordinary and exceptional. 
For the time being, this shouldn't matter much given that there is only 1 class in 
these exceptional markings.

Yesterday I got PNNs working nicely! If only every day were that productive!
This morning (well, until 2:30PM!) I cleaned up MJPdes. 
Today we experiment with the idea of replacing euclid-dist2 with some notion of "pn network distance."

- Places are dimensions, movement can be along one or more dimensions. 
- Transitions are the things that determine movement; only dimensions referenced in the
  transition change between states. 
- Each marking has an associated classification. Markings that are very dissimilar from the
  classified marking should have a large distance measure from it. EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE ENSURES THIS.
  The PDF distributes the classification among each training instance. 

- I was concerned about the proximity of activity over time. That changes according to rates. 
  If one part of the network has high-rate transitions, we'd expect more activity from it. But so what?
- I was thinking about "locality of reference" -- that with each transition, only connected places change. 

--> Maybe then what I'm after is to use the distance between transitions in the measure of 
    distance between states. 
    Q: But what does that mean? 
    A: A transition occurs -- we want to learn the relationship between transition and the emission of 
       exceptional messages. This is a temporal relationship (E.g. How many steps after firing X do
       I see exceptional message M?) This isn't judged by pn-path stuff, it is by reachability graph!

Maybe just do the Euclidean distance between markings times the number of steps. 

- There is nothing preventing 
- Transitions that are far from the

Another productive day (without really working too hard!). 
The distance function that I'm using is strictly distance between nodes in the rgraph. 
I use loom to calculate this (20 minutes work). 
I'm moving the parzen-pdf-msg stuff from pnn to fitness.

See Agenda. Today I'm integrating the exceptional messages, and inhibitors.
First, however, is to look into the possibly erroneous marking state found yesterday:

[0 1 0 0 1] [:m2-starved 0.1690133154060661], ; <---- Needs investigation. Should not be in rgraph!

[:buffer :m1-blocked :m1-busy :m2-busy :m2-starved]
Means that m1 is blocked, yet there is nothing in the buffer. How does this come about?
It is a vanishing state from m1-complete-job to m1-start-job. 
So it is okay. 

The problem I'm having with init-pop seems to be that plans don't have names. 
This was probably erroneously removed when MJPdes was prettified. 

*** More unnecessary code:
#_(defn mjpdes2pn-trace
  "Translate all the SCADA message maps with maps with 'nice pn names."

OK, first interesting thing is that I've been using a N=3 example, but now, of course, 
all the instances start as N=1. I guess that was expected, but it is making it harder
to sync-up in "starting-links"

--> I remove exceptional processing. No help! Still slow! WTF is it doing???

Is it that the agent is forcing things into one process??? Need to watch process meter!!
** <2017-10-28 Sat>

*** Slow Runtime investigation

Yesterday: Is it that the agent is forcing things into one process??? Need to watch process meter!!
I think that it is that I don't have an ABORT that actually leaves the loop, and that
I don't have a record (defonce atom) ? of old evolve-chan. OTOH, these are suppose to park.

[[http://www.bradcypert.com/clojure-async/][Brad Cypert on Core.Async]] 

**** Before I started, there were two processes called main. 
    MJPdes (started with lein repl) gets two processes called main too.  
    Also get two with C-c M-j on MJPdes.
    Starting fresh I get one. (fan starts/stops) Now two again 869 and 784
    Killing 684 kills both.
    ====> One starts just as the REPL server starts. --> One for program, one for repl (nREPL). 
**** Pipe taking 30% of a CPU. Killed it. 
**** Code suggests that nothing starts just by loading. 
**** Oh so well behaved today!
    Got more than 500% CPU and CPU dropped to 0.1% when done. 
**** Big-reset didn't save on old-channel. (Reload doesn't obey defonce ???)
    Also, no message that would suggest that ABORT happened. 
*** Resolved runtime, but exceptional is slow!

It is not just slow, it is stuck, I think. Aborting doesn't abort. Some of those 
pmapped things are probably still running -- hung: 
**** Need timeouts on pmapped processes???

*** This was first attempt at pmap-timeout (though I didn't know it at the time!)
(def running "Vector of futures" (atom []))
(def promises "Promises of running individuals." (atom []))

(def sched-chan ; POD defonce
  "A channel with a buffer equal to the number of cpu/hyperthreads."
  (async/chan (-> (app-info) :gp-system :use-cpus)))


(defn schedule-work
  "Schedule an individual to run; return a promise."
  [inv work]
  (>!! sched-chan (:id inv)) ; block if full
    (future (deliver p (work inv))
            (<!! sched-chan)) ; make room for more
    p))

(defn finished-work
  "Deref a promise (with timeout) and pull from channel to free up a spot."
  [p]
  (let [result (deref p 10000 :timeout)]
    (cl-format *out* "~%~A finished with ~A" (<!! sched-chan) result)
    result))


***    13:45 - pmap-timeout working....
    ... but I'm back to having 700% CPU when nothing (useful) is running.  
   
    Agents allow shared access to mutable state. 
    (send-off @the-agent evolve-continue @the-promise evolve-chan)

    So I'm asking the agent to run evolve-continue, as opposed to just running evolve-continue
    in a thread with future. 

    I am not able to use (shutdown-agents) (nREPL uses agents). So maybe I try this 
    with a future? 

    The nice thing about agents is the error handler....
    No difference. So SLOWWWW

    Let's see if the pmap-timeout is implicated. 
    A: No, not really. It gets stuck on 100% rather than 800% so we can at least debug it. 

>>>>>    the-promise never gets delivered. 
>>>>>    Delivering it by hand doesn't help.

Temporarily, I'm not reset! the-future to nil. When I print it out:
         (try @@the-future (catch Exception e (str e)))
            "java.util.concurrent.CancellationException"


This 700% problem is really weird. 
(clojure.core.async/thread) shows one thread. 

I *think* I now know why it would hang in the map case (as opposed to my pmap-timeout case):
 It gets stuck on simple-reach. Next time I'll get the PN!!!

For the 700% case, it is probably true that future-cancel isn't doing what I hoped (terminating the thread)

***** Huh?
Okay, I expected some trouble, but not this. The map here is not blocking!
Furthermore, it takes maxtime rather than the actual execution time!
I see one problem in that the system might not really start the process when I do go.
I can fix that with a promise that delivers the time and channel. Let's try that first,

Yesterday's was better! It didn't stop either, but it used all the processors:
times = [3000 {:timeout 5000} {:timeout 5000} {:timeout 5000} {:timeout 5000} 1000 3000 2000]
"Elapsed time: 5007.784076 msecs"
29000

I'll update yesterday's to send the actual launch time in the promise, then I'm calling it quits.

I REALLY NEED TO GIVE UP! However, when it does get stuck, it gets stuck while starting the 
first eight. For example, the running-cnt stops at 2 or 3.

Unlike Friday's episode, restarting the client is not helping. 
However, restarting completely -- lein restart-repl -- did the trick. 
Could it be that running -- diag-run -- before having the client up messes up the client?

** <2017-10-30 Mon>

The hopeful PN produces this rgraph, which apparently is not sufficient to parse the log. 

 {:rgraph
  [{:M [1 0 0 0 0], :fire :m1-start-job, :Mp [0 1 0 0 1], :rate 1.0}
   {:M [0 1 0 0 1], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 0 1 0 1], :rate 1.0}

   {:M [0 0 0 1 0], :fire :m2-complete-job, :Mp [1 0 0 0 0], :rate 1.0}],

The log looks like this:

[{:act :m1-complete-job, :bf :b1, :j 1689, :n 0, :clk 1999.9234365080201, :line 0, :mjpact :bj, :m :m1}

The reason that it can't model the log is that it isn't looking at job-ids. 
If instead of what I'm doing, I started with (like the log shows) m1-complete-job j 1689 on line 0,
then I can jump down to :m2-start-job j 1689 on line 3. THIS is parsing the log!

TUESDAY CLARIFICATION: Parsing the log must still means doing things in the order
specified by the reachability graph! The problem MIGHT be different from what 
I describe above. The reason it can't parse the log is that the argument PN has a buffer 
of only 1, so it can't express the level of asynchronicity in the log??? (FALSE?).

WHATEVER! First fix regression testing, then see what good the job assignments might provide.

What I need is indeed, "next-ordinary-message-on-job" and I need to count what messages
I parsed and remove them / associate them with the job. 
When I'm done, I count what content I accounted for by each. 
EASY PEASY. 

<2017-10-31 Tue>

Well, maybe not so easy. First, there is the matter that we need to keep moving ahead with
new jobs in order to parse the entire log. Secondly, there is the technical problem of 
where (in what object) do we keep notice of consumption of a message. 

I'll try to create a map with the messages and other data and validate with the 
N=3 pn... 
  -rw-r--r--   1 pdenno  pdenno  334035 Oct 15 12:03 m2-j1-n3-block-mild-out.clj
So I'll just attach the 334k log to every PN. Let's see how good the GC is!

C-c C-t n has apparently been lying to me!
** <2017-10-31 Tue>

On the way to exploring the "more flexible" interpretation of the log, I found and
fixed a bug in starting-links (the "distinct" thing). This might not have an effect
on functionality. 

I now pass in most information *including the log* through pn. The idea is to track
which job is consuming which message, a relaxation of the log interpretation to account
for a lack of (or insufficient) buffer. 
** <2017-11-01 Wed>

==> I believe that today's algorithm subsumes functionality of disorder-fitness.

  (let [data (:log pn)
        last-ix (:last-line pn)] ; POD put on pn

      (if (> indx last-ix)
        nil
        (if-let [msg (and (ordinary? (nth data indx))
                          (== (:j (nth data indx)) jid))]
          msg
          (recur (inc indx)))))))

[{:M [0 0 1 1 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 1 0 1 0], :rate 0.9, :indx 0, :job 1689}
 {:M [1 0 1 1 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [1 1 0 1 0], :rate 0.9, :indx 0, :job 1689}]

First one failed on 
{:msg

  :indx 9,

Even if second one succeeds, it is doing so only on buffer size, thus something needs adjustment. 
Hmmm, maybe not; at :Mp buffer is 2.

  :relax? :active}}

Second is really messed up! :m2-complete-job at 129, then it chooses :m2-complete-job ???

Log looks like this:

So how did the last action become :indx 129 :m2-complete-job ???

Should I update :graph-link on an :active ? I think so. I did. 
Need to see the whole interp. Where is 128? 
  {:M [2 1 0 1 0],

   :indx 129,
   :relax? :active}]}

(filter #(= (:Mp glink) (:M %)) (:rgraph pn))]

Needs :fire like for normal messages. 
Something is wrong with the way I'm thinking about this, because when I add the 
extra condition, things stop after just a few lines.

There is no question that the message condition has to be there -- that's the message!
So it must be that I'm screwing up on :M / :Mp YEAH -- THOSE shouldn't be in the condition!

8 seconds!!!

(def pnpn (tryme)) ;; Then uncomment...

If still slow, try shorting out the call to the Djikstra thing.

Something changed, because now it takes 1200 milliseconds. Acceptable, barely.

Yeah, without Djikstra it finishes in 50 milliseconds and still goes all the way.
What gives?

*** Tomorrow
So it only hits "ordinary" about 200 times!
Why isn't new job ordinary? Why does that create a disconnect; it didn't 
before I wrote this!
(In fact, EVERYTHING worked without Djikstra on this test case!)
** <2017-11-02 Thu>

Force everything in this test case through the old method.
If can't get it down to 100 msec, consider using FIRST interpretation. 
Don't commit until this is figured out. 

Get's through 565. Very odd. 
Aha! Gets throug 565 for the *second* start link. Gets through all 3000 for the *first*!

43 milliseconds!

[{:M [0 0 1 1 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 1 0 1 0], :rate 0.9, :indx 0, :job 1689}
 {:M [1 0 1 1 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [1 1 0 1 0], :rate 0.9, :indx 0, :job 1689}]

The system is, in fact, in the situation of the first!
{:act :m1-complete-job, :bf :b1, :j 1689, :n 0, :clk 1999.9234365080201, :line 0, :mjpact :bj, :m :m1}

OK, now we have lax-reach which on hopeful-pn is k-limited. It has this rgraph:
 :rgraph
 ({:M [0 1 0 0 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 0 1 0 0], :rate 1.0}
  {:M [0 0 1 0 0], :fire :m1-start-job,    :Mp [0 1 0 0 1], :rate 1.0}
  {:M [0 1 0 0 1], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 0 1 0 1], :rate 1.0}
  {:M [0 0 1 0 1], :fire :m1-start-job,    :Mp [0 1 0 0 2], :rate 1.0}
  {:M [0 1 0 0 2], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [0 0 1 0 2], :rate 1.0}),

place-103 is indeed what I intend to be a buffer.

:marking-key [:place-1 :place-2 :place-3 :place-4 :Place-103],
Note that there is no transition out of [0 0 1 0 2]. Can this be fixed? 

Things are not going well with the repair. The lax idea is okay, but instead of
one token on :m1, I should have 1 token on each machine. Exception will work 
to specify the buffer sizes.

Let's see if the problem is that N=3 and lax is set to two. Maybe first I'll try lax set to 3. 
YUP! That's an easy test! 

*** Thinking about how interpretation should really work:
So I think I need the converse of lax-reach: lax-interp which will:
  1) Allow "pushing to full buffers"  when no other transition (but only up to "max-buffer" = 10 to terminate early) 
  2) Allow "pulling from  empty buffers" when no other transition. 

To do this:
 a) Must determine what places are buffers.
 b) Must be able to determine which place is the problem, and whether it is 
 c) There are two "when no other transition" conditions" -- I guess that isn't a problem though (zero or two tells you).

Hmmm... Maybe the easiest way to implement this isn't to extend into a larger reachability set, but
        rather just make jobs magically appear and disappear... UNFORTUNATELY, that will screw up 
        job tracking. 

**** Three alternatives then:
 (1): Extend the k-max bound on-the-fly as you get into failure situations.
 (2): Add jobs to deal with not having false starvation, remove jobs to deal with false blocking.
 (3): Do what I just did: Run lax-reach again with a higher number. 

(3) is by far the easiest, and I don't think it is computationally expensive either. 
    I'm going to try (3)!!!

This needs to wrap lax-reach and interp in a loop. Refactoring!

It is probably the case that the next-link stuff can be simplified, 
use of Djikstra etc. removed. This is obviated by the max-k-used approach.

** <2017-11-06 Mon>

I'm going to let yesterday's bug slide, because I don't think it hurts anything. 
I'm cleaning up all the mess from yesterday's conflict over whether the implementation
in fact conforms to the math -- it does. The problem is in the "artifacts of 
inaccessible formalisms" -- formalisms which get elided in the Parzen window 
implementation.

Problem ----> ((-> pnpn :pdf-fns :m1-unblocked) [3 0 1 1 0])
It looks like it can't do the Djikstra graph search (no successors* for class nil)

Indeed, we are again working with the markings in a different order!
:loom-graph and :rgraph match up. msg-table DOES NOT.

There could be problems with graphs (not ergodic, traps and siphons?) that make 
the distance function fail???

from =  [0 0 1 1 2]  to =  [0 1 0 1 0]

----> It looks like it can't do the Djikstra graph search (no successors* for class nil)
Even with the pnpn issue fixed I get this. The reason is that the GRAPH is nil. 



Did those couple of wrong values do this much damage? It looks to be the case!

There are 16 markings in the msg-table and 28 markings in the rgraph. 

So it is a little bit worse today for some reason:

Q: Is what I'm calling the original-msg-table also in the Powerpoint? 
A: No, there is a discrepency due to moving things around for 10 4 vs 14. 
And the marking-key has changed so, I'm not investigating. 

---> Key problem: I need to look at alternative formulations, some as simple as changing sigma, 
     but also straight (no Euclidean) and normalized. 

I think a probabilistic one will be best. I could calculate the probability of 
transition from each state to other state just by looking at the interpretation. 
I don't think the formulation I have in mind is a Markov chain, because I'm not interested
in the "no op" transition to self. 

Ideally what I'd like is the probability of transition between two states
where there are multiple paths between the states (sum of all the paths).
But what does that mean? Some paths have cycles. It's not like I'm looking
for some steady state kind of thing. 

A simplification that I can understand is to find the shortest path and calculate
the probability of that path. 

*** Maybe better than the above is to put 1/probabilities on the transitions and make 
it find the shortest path that way. DO THIS!

Okay, First step is to continue to process the interpretation, producing transition 
probabilities for every pair where there is a transition.

HMMM---> Now set the links in the loom graph to 1/P - 1, (e.g. if there is not alternative). 
         If this looks too "harsh," try log(1/p).
Yeah, I'll go with this. The alternative is to not use the costs in Djikstra and instead
do product of 1/p for each link. 

1/p - 1 looks pretty tough!

                               place-2 is busy. 

I'm continuing on with the WHY?
Maybe it is syncing on :M and should be on :Mp ?

  0          1        0          1      1         (That really isn't m2-starving because it is busy!)
                                                  (Busy and one in the buffer, it won't even transition to starving.)

[1] "wrong-iness" because it doesn't add to the buffer??? The transition is tecnically correct! 
[2] Here it does add to the buffer. I think this is okay. To do otherwise is to invite problems.

*** Leading to definition of starved? 
So I don't see a case for [0 1 0 1 1] being m2-starved in the log at all. Buffer has 1!
Let's look at what is happening when m2 starves. Two situations, supposedly. 

[3] {:M [0 1 0 1 1], :fire :m2-complete-job,       :Mp [1 1 0 0 1], :rate 1.0, :job 1744, :clk 2066.1692850612535, :indx 224}
[4] {:act :m2-starved, :prev-act :m2-complete-job, :Mp [1 1 0 0 1], :clk 2066.1692850612535, :job 1744            :indx 225,}
    {:M [1 0 1 0 1], :fire :m1-start-job,          :Mp [1 1 0 0 2], :rate 1.0, :job 1746, :clk 2067.08452126566, :indx 227}
    {:M [1 1 0 0 2], :fire :m2-start-job,          :Mp [0 1 0 1 1], :rate 1.0, :job 1745, :clk 2067.08452126566, :indx 228}
    {:act :m2-unstarved, :prev-act :m2-start-job, :indx 229, :Mp [0 1 0 1 1], :clk 2067.08452126566, :job 1745}

     This [4] is *wrong*. There is one in the buffer. Should penalize an interpretation that matches
     a starvation to having something in the buffer. In other respects it is "continuous." 
     Either way, it doesn't explain the :m2-starved in PNN, but fix the interpretation first. 
     Really need a look-ahead at [3] to see that [4] is starve. Going to have to work backwards
     from starvations!. Also call it :state (not :Mp)

====> starved? written.

This should have failed starved? 

*** Bug in MJPdes
====> I have a new (better) interpretation now, but I'm not happy with what MJPdes is doing.
It is putting :m2-start-job messages [5] before :unstarve messages, resulting in the 
wrong state on exceptional [6] . 

What sucks about this is that to fix it, I need a new log. 

{:M [1 1 0 0 1], :fire :m2-start-job, :Mp [0 1 0 1 0], :rate 1.0, :m :m2, :job 1744, :clk 2064.9992850612534, :indx 223}

{:M [1 1 0 0 0], :fire :m1-complete-job, :Mp [1 0 1 0 0], :rate 1.0, :m :m1, :job 1745, :clk 2067.08452126566, :indx 226}
{:M [1 0 1 0 0], :fire :m1-start-job, :Mp [1 1 0 0 1], :rate 1.0, :m :m1, :job 1746, :clk 2067.08452126566, :indx 227}
[5] {:M [1 1 0 0 1], :fire :m2-start-job, :Mp [0 1 0 1 0], :rate 1.0, :m :m2, :job 1745, :clk 2067.08452126566, :indx 228}
[6] {:act :m2-unstarved, :prev-act :m2-start-job, :Mp [0 1 0 1 0], :state [0 1 0 1 0], :clk 2067.08452126566, :job 1745, :indx 229}

...so essentially, I have more to do. 
It may even be the case that I'll want to terminate interpretations where
unstarve is happening but the buffer is empty.

*** starved? is established and I got all the test cases in fitness_test.clj working. 
 Internet is down.
*** I'm looking at an alternative PNN measure: product of probabilities
This would be perfect were Loom to provide all (or a reasonable subset of) paths between nodes. 
But I don't think it can do that. Checking... Nothing. 

Q: What if I got a first graph and then tried to get subgraphs? 
A: I don't think it would give me anything new unless I changed the costs. 
Q: Then why not change costs on this entire path and see what it can do? 
A: Maybe.
Q: What if I keep the path I have but recalculate the distance as a product?
A: This should be easy...

It fails on starved? because indeed the :Mp here isn't starved. 

So we go from (m1-busy, m2-busy, 1 in buffer) to (m1-busy m2-waiting) but there is still one in the 
buffer, so yeah, this is supposed to fail. 

This isn't the winning initial-marking. Do I try other buffer settings? 
It should start with 1 in buffer because:

Maybe it would be work to move the "if neither is exceptional" to the bottom.

*** I played around a bit with utils4pmap and eventually gave up.
  See comments in the code. Contrary to what I had believed before, it *does not* pass the
  busy-fn test. That, at least, is a positive, since I can now test it without sinet. 
  Further, I have a diagnostic atom on the memberes that shows that, in the case of busy-fn, 
  the catch for interrupts never gets invoked. 
  The only way forward is to find a way to get the interrupt handled by run-away code.

I changed the distance from [0 1 0 1 0] to [1 1 0 0 1] Correct?
Correct. In the latter output, I commented out this line, which should have increased the distance:
(assoc-in ?pn [:trans-counts [0 1 0 1 0] [1 1 0 0 0]] 1020)
Correct. Distance went from 6.75 to 9.21. 
(Math/exp -9.2)   ==> 0.00010103940183709342
(Math/exp -6.75)  ==> 0.0011708796207911744
So the transition is 10 times more significant at 6.76 than 9.2. 
The problem is that these aren't very significant relative to 1.0 at distance 0. 

This should have made the score for :original better. Did it? 
Without 1020: 0.08015732928344184
With    1020: 0.08015732928344184
With/ou 1001: 0.08015732928344184

Okay, maybe that doesn't make sense. 
There is enough information above to calculate the values deliberately and see what we get. 

***** Back to the point (again): It works as intended. What about it could be improved?

Here is why it doesn't make any difference:
term =  2.046191895297324E-62
term =  2.5611416543021165E-45
term =  217.0

0.083432 with Sqrt
0.083430

((:ordinary   (:pdf-fns pnpn)) [1 1 0 0 1]) ==> 0.09338080837745166
((:m2-starved (:pdf-fns pnpn)) [1 1 0 0 1]) ==> 0.26359713811572677

Why would sqrt make the difference larger?

((:ordinary (:pdf-fns pnpn)) [1 1 0 0 1])   ==> 0.07534353911645686
((:m2-starved (:pdf-fns pnpn)) [1 1 0 0 1]) ==> 0.02302358470854968

  I worked on the JMS paper, adding the interpretation algorithm.
** <2017-11-15 Wed>
  In the meeting with Charles we decided to work on the causal piece, with a goal
  of having that complete (and in the paper, if possible) in a week. 
  I might then go back and add more algorithms to the PNN table. 

The "causal piece" involves lot of work on spntools, but I'm going to document that here. 

OK, so I put :rate-fn in :next-links. I have not yet traced through how these functions
would be used in the process of tangible rates. But let's give what we have a try, 
and see if it generates the same values as in the test case. (I think it won't because
there was some math in composing the tangible rates that isn't yet expressed ???

(Actually the example has no :IMMs so it isn't going to matter.) 

  {:M [1 0 0 1 1 0 0],
   :fire :Treq1,
   :Mp [0 1 0 1 1 0 0],
   :rate-fn (clojure.core/fn [gov.nist.spntools.util.reach/rates] (:Treq1 gov.nist.spntools.util.reach/rates)),
   :rate 1.0}

** <2017-11-16 Thu>

*** Comments I don't need
OK, not much time invested, but let's finish this thing!

      ;; Every link in M2Mp provides a rate between *states*. Can I trace from the rate of
      ;; a transition to rates of these states? Is this essentially just going through the
      ;; reachability graph with new values or is there something I can do here that is
      ;; more effective? When I was working on this code, I seemed to believe that the Q-matrix
      ;; code was an appropriate place to make this parametric. Looking at Marsan....

      ;; The transition rate from state si (corresponding to marking Mi) to state sj (Mj) is obtained
      ;; as the sum of the firing rates of the transitions that are enabled in Mi and whose firings
      ;; generate marking Mj.

      ;;; That means sum rates of all transitions that have

      ;; That's great, except that I'm starting from the premise that I'm changing one of the lambdas.
      ;; I need an algebraic associated with the transition. Have to be careful about this because
      ;; it is a function of reachability. 


Oh man, a little more involved that I thought!
Might have to keep around links that aren't directly used. ...Or some such thing. 

**** In principle, it should not be necessary to keep around links other than those that actually appear in the PN. 
     For example, in calc-vpath-rate I define :vrate-fn, which multiplies a path of rates. 
***** Note that it looks necessary to keep around these for cycles:
          - :Qt-states
          - :Qtv-states
          .... Nope, that's not a good idea! Need to use a closure in these cases! 
               (because these properties are for each loop) .

** <2017-11-17 Fri>

I fixed a problem with vanish-matrices that I caused yesterday: I seemed to forget that 
the function returns the whole ?calc object and that might need some of these additional
keys! It needed :Qt-states. 

*** Okay, I'm not going to pursue loops past Grace's appointment, but while I'm here....
**** Firstly, I might *have* to pursue this a little further, might not be just about loops! (Verify.)
 - vanish-matrices produces :loop-rates and :lv-St, which is further wrapped up in the caller, loop-reduce-vpath.
 - loop-reduce-vpath is called from follow-vpath-loop and transfers :loop-rates and :lv-St 
   *into* :new-vpath-rates and :new-St respectively.
 - *follow-vpath* either calls *follow-vpath-to-tang* or *follow-vpath-loop*. *Both of these set :new-vpath-rates.*
 - reach-reduce-vpaths (toplevel reduce of vpaths, called from tangible-reach-graph) calls 
   *follow-vpath* and *into-v-rates* 

*** A very useful call graph!
reachability -> tangible-reach-graph -> reach-step-tangible
                                        reach-reduce-vpaths -> into-v-rates (after follow-vpath)
                                                               follow-vpath -> follow-vpath-to-tang
                                                                               follow-vpath-loop

follow-vpath-to-tang -> calc-vpath-rate (set :vrate-fn). 


follow-vpath-loop -> loop-reduce-vpath -> vanishing-matrices. 

*** TODO Strategy based on the call graph. 

Looking at this, I would say I need to know what into-v-rates does in order to know what :vrate-fn is supposed to do. 
A: It simply updates :v-rates (one line). Much like conj-t-rate.  (:t-rates, :v-rates). 

(defn summarize-reach
  "Merge :vpath-rates and :explored (sans vanishing) resulting in :M2Mp"
  [pn]
  (as-> pn ?pn
    (assoc ?pn :M2Mp (into (distinct (:t-rates ?pn))
                           (distinct (:v-rates ?pn)))) 
    (dissoc ?pn :explored :vexplored :spaths :t-rates :v-rates))) ; keep

If all goes well, then I'd have a :rate-fn on the appropriate links in :M2Mp. 
Marsan69 is an example. 

SUPER! I see that some links have :vrate-fn. If I just change that to :rate-fn ???

Well, a little more to it, since :fire is a list...Hang on. That's not quite right. 
It references next-links for rates, and these aren't a list.  So "simple syntax approach" should be okay. 

{[:Tpar1 :t_syn :t_ok] 0.5,
 [:Tpar1 :t_syn :t_ko] 0.5,
 [:Tcheck :t_start] 1.0,
 [:Tpar2 :t_syn :t_ok] 0.5,
 [:Tpar2 :t_syn :t_ko] 0.5,
 [:Tndata :t_start] 1.0,
 :Tpar1 1.0,
 :Tpar2 1.0,
 :Tio 1.0}

This rate table is kind of interesting! Shows just what I expect to get back!
((-> (:M2Mp pnpn) first :rate-fn) rrr)

[{:M [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0], :fire :Tpar1, :Mp [0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0], :rate 1.0} 
 {:M [0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0], :fire :t_syn, :Mp [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0], :rate 1.0} 
 {:M [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0], :fire :t_ok, :Mp [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1],  :rate 0.5}] 

It looks like going after rates off the transitions is wrong somehow and that
I should be going after the ones in these links. 

 *However, these links are intermediate information.* That means, you would be getting what was closed-over, 
  not a new computation. 

{:t_ko 1.0, 
 :t_ok 1.0, 
 :t_start 1.0, 
 :t_syn 1.0, 
 :Tcheck 1.0, 
 :Tio 1.0, 
 :Tndata 1.0, 
 :Tpar1 1.0, 
 :Tpar2 1.0}

t_ok is 1.0 but it competes with t_ko. There is a 1.0 rate into this 

(pnr/next-links pnpn [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0])

[{:M [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0],
  :fire :t_ko,
  :Mp [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0],
  :rate-fn #function[gov.nist.spntools.util.reach/next-links/fn--12693/fn--12694],
  :rate 0.5}
 {:M [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0],
  :fire :t_ok,
  :Mp [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1],
  :rate-fn #function[gov.nist.spntools.util.reach/next-links/fn--12693/fn--12694],
  :rate 0.5}]

So I'm getting new rate functions out of these links. I should be calling that, 
not pulling the rate out of table for the :fire.

Hurray! No loops in m3.xml 
Calculating its reachability graph takes 4.4 secs however. 

Works great! In m3.xml, if I increase the rate of M2, then 
  - M2 starves and blocks more.
  - Buffer occupancy from the buffer M2 pulls from decreases.
  - Buffer occupancy from the buffer M2 put to increases.

I think I'll stop here and write this up. 
** <2017-11-19 Sun>

I worked on the paper. Finished the PNN diagram, I think. 

** <2017-11-20 Mon>
I worked on the paper, 

I worked on the paper. Put in the causal stuff. Sent a copy to Charles and Jenny. 

** <2017-11-21 Tue>

I worked on the paper. I cleaned things up, particularly early in the paper. 

** <2017-11-22 Wed>

*** Paper 
I worked on the paper until 5PM. I made a ToDo list of things needed; cleaned up several parts. 
Charles and Jenny didn't think it was that far off. 
They suggest doing 3 things well, rather than trying to explain everything. I agree;
the ToDo list is about this. What I'm not talking about is a lot of GP stuff and Multi-model. 

*** Code
  Goal for the code is to get exceptional fitness pushing out individuals with queues. 
  I think I'll start by just pushing the structure into qualifying PNs (e.g. hopeful-pn)
  when it is determined. I'll watch if such individuals can initiate and rise to the top. 
  If that occurs, then maybe note the PN and allow a semantic genetic operator to operate
  on some such instances randomly. 

**** So what are the circumstances for initiating N=3 ? 
   1) k-bound to 3 -- need to recognize it and what place is being referred to.
   2) exceptional blocking on 3 -- (once the k=3 place is recognized?)

***** 
1) We know that :m1-blocked is a blocking message (:mjpact :bl :m :m1) (write scada/info-on-msg)
2) (util/buffers-between fitt/hopeful-pn :m1 :m2) ===> :Place-103

***** If this works, then (someday) I might want to "vectorize" k-binding. 
      Meaning that each place would have its own k value. 




Somehow, I have to conclude that :m1-blocked is a blocking message:

[:place-1 :place-2 :place-3 :place-4 :Place-103]

Been away from this for a while!
I updated to java 9, now nothing works. Is that really the reason? 
Maybe not, I dropped back to java 8. Still NG. 
Hmmm... I didn't really drop back! Oracle instructions for removing java didn't work?
Also the java control center doesn't report any version. java -version reports 9 still.
The Oracle instructions were for 1.9, not 1.9.1 (or whatever it is I had). 

As I said on Nov 22:

  Goal for the code is to get exceptional fitness pushing out individuals with queues. 
  I think I'll start by just pushing the structure into qualifying PNs (e.g. hopeful-pn)
  when it is determined. I'll watch if such individuals can initiate and rise to the top. 
  If that occurs, then maybe note the PN and allow a semantic genetic operator to operate

... Specifically, I wrote buffers-to-constrain.

ptaoussanis involved in both http-kit and sente, but http-kit started by shenfeng.
ptaoussanis is about the only one contributing to http-kit now. 

I am still trying to get a usable abort from running (diag-run) with a population
that contains nets with no places. All the nets in the population have no places, 
but that is beside the point; diag-run just sits there and smokes. Adding try/catch
and (>!! (rep/evolve-chan) "abort") isn't helping. 

When I find something that works, maybe a macro (handling-evolve ....)

*** Reading the Busi and Pinna paper, it is about safe nets with one "source place" and one "sink place". 
So I don't think it is very helpful.

*** Don't 'add choice' as a genetic operator, unless that is semantically what is intended!

Maybe this same sort of advice applies to all the operators (making it more deterministic?).
The above PN has two transitions between the same two places. (One has an additional outbound
to a third place, but that is beside the point, since that can be simplified.) 

*** Debugging the current exceptional -- How do the marking proliferate like this?

Oh how I would love for my pmap stuff to work! (What it does, I think is return with
timeout but not kill the thread.)

It takes way too long to compute! A first step might be to declare failure 
when the number of tokens in a marking exceed  k*(m - 1) + m. 

It might even make sense to fail when a place other than a buffer has a more than one token. 

--> Maybe make :info -- part of pn that says what looks like a buffer, what looks like
    machine state. 


*** Determine whether hopeful-pn is achievable with the current operators.
